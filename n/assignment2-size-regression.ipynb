MSE, RMSE, or MAE are better be used to compare performance between different regression models. Personally, I would prefer using RMSE and I think Kaggle also uses it to assess the submission. However, it makes total sense to use MSE if the value is not too big and MAE if you do not want to penalize large prediction errors.\n",
